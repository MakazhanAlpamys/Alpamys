IMPORTANT: ADD ICON.PNG FILE
================================

Please add an icon.png file to this folder (src/assets/icon.png)

This icon will be used for:
1. Browser favicon (tab icon)
2. Logo in the navigation bar (top left corner)

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG
- Size: 512x512px (or at least 256x256px)
- Square image
- Should look good when scaled down to 32x32px
- Transparent background recommended

The icon should represent you or your brand. Ideas:
- Your initials (A.M.)
- A simple logo design
- A minimalist coding icon
- Any symbol that represents your work

After adding the file, it will automatically appear in the browser tab and navigation bar.
